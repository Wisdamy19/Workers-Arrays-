# Workers-Arrays-
Introductory exercises in object-oriented programming with Arrays in Java.

Make a program to read an integer N and then the data (id, name and salary) of
N employees. There should be no repetition of id.
Then increase the salary of a particular employee by X percent.
To do this, the program must read an id and the value X. If the id entered does not exist, display a
message and abort the operation. At the end, show the updated list of employees,
as shown in the examples.
Remember to apply the encapsulation technique so that the salary cannot be freely changed.
be changed freely. A salary can only be increased based on a given
increase operation.
